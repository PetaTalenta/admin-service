### 4. Health Checks and Monitoring

**Health Check Endpoints**:
- `GET /health` - Basic health check
- `GET /health/detailed` - Detailed health with database status
- `GET /health/ready` - Readiness probe
- `GET /health/live` - Liveness probe

**Docker Health Check**:
```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=40s --retries=3
```

**Monitoring Capabilities**:
- Container health status
- Resource usage tracking
- Database connection monitoring
- Cache availability checking
- Real-time log streaming

### 5. Production Deployment Procedures

**Deployment Steps Documented**:
1. Environment preparation
2. Image building and tagging
3. Service deployment with dependencies
4. Health verification
5. Rolling updates
6. Rollback procedures

**Maintenance Procedures**:
- Daily health checks
- Weekly log rotation
- Monthly security audits
- Backup procedures
- Emergency response plans

3. **No Unnecessary Packages**: Production-only dependencies
4. **Health Checks**: Automated failure detection
5. **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory limits configured

### Network Security
1. **Internal Network**: Services communicate via internal bridge network
2. **Port Exposure**: Only necessary ports exposed
3. **TLS Ready**: Configuration for SSL/TLS termination at gateway
4. **Environment Secrets**: Sensitive data via environment variables

### Operational Security
1. **Log Management**: Structured logging with rotation
2. **Audit Trail**: All admin actions logged
3. **Access Control**: Role-based access via auth service

## Known Limitations and Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
1. **Single Instance**: No horizontal scaling configured yet
2. **Manual Deployment**: CI/CD pipeline not yet automated
3. **Basic Monitoring**: Advanced metrics collection not implemented
4. **Alert System**: In-memory alerts (should move to database)

### Recommended Improvements
1. **Kubernetes Migration**: For better orchestration and scaling
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment
3. **Advanced Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana integration
4. **Distributed Tracing**: OpenTelemetry implementation
5. **Service Mesh**: Istio or Linkerd for advanced traffic management
