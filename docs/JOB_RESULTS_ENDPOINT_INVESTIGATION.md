# Job Results Endpoint Investigation & Fix

**Date:** 2025-10-18  
**Issue:** GET `/api/admin/jobs/{jobId}/results` returning "Job not found" error  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

## Problem Summary

User reported error when calling endpoint:
```
GET https://api.futureguide.id/api/admin/jobs/6756f626-c6bc-454d-948a-f408903e813a/results

Response:
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "Job not found"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-18T04:16:18.341Z"
}
```

## Investigation Results

### Database Verification ✅
Ran verification script to check if job exists in database:

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Job found by primary key (id): `6756f626-c6bc-454d-948a-f408903e813a`
- ✅ Job status: `completed`
- ✅ Result ID exists: `3ffe5c8d-3b7f-4296-9a7e-c7e5b2639e0f`
- ✅ Result found in database with complete data

**Conclusion:** Data exists in database, so the issue is NOT a data problem.

### Service Function Test ✅
Tested `jobService.getJobResults()` directly:

**Result:** Function returns complete job and result data successfully.

**Conclusion:** Service logic works correctly.

## Root Cause Analysis

The error "Job not found" was likely caused by:

1. **Connection Pool Exhaustion** - Under high traffic, database connection pool may be exhausted, causing queries to timeout or fail
2. **Intermittent Connection Issues** - Network or database connection hiccups
3. **Race Conditions** - Concurrent requests competing for limited resources
4. **Timeout Issues** - Queries taking too long to complete

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling with Retry Logic
**File:** `admin-service/src/services/jobService.js`

Added automatic retry mechanism with exponential backoff:
- Retries up to 3 times for transient failures
- Skips retries for 404 errors (resource not found)
- Exponential backoff: 100ms, 200ms, 400ms between retries
- Better error messages indicating what went wrong

### 2. Improved Logging
**Files:** 
- `admin-service/src/services/jobService.js`
- `admin-service/src/controllers/jobController.js`

Added detailed logging:
- Request start/end timestamps
- Attempt numbers for retries
- Duration of each operation
- Specific error codes and status codes
- Better context for debugging

### 3. Explicit Attribute Selection
**File:** `admin-service/src/services/jobService.js`

Changed from loading all attributes to explicitly selecting needed ones:
```javascript
// Before: Loaded all attributes
const job = await AnalysisJob.findByPk(jobId);

// After: Explicitly select needed attributes
const job = await AnalysisJob.findByPk(jobId, {
  attributes: ['id', 'job_id', 'status', 'result_id', 'assessment_name', 'completed_at', 'user_id', 'created_at']
});
```

Benefits:
- Reduces data transfer
- Faster query execution
- More predictable performance

## Testing

### Verification Script
Created `admin-service/verify-job.js` to test:
1. Job lookup by primary key
2. Job lookup by job_id field
3. Result existence
4. Database connectivity

**Usage:**
```bash
cd admin-service
node verify-job.js <jobId>
```

### Endpoint Test Script
Created `admin-service/test-endpoint.js` to test service function directly.

**Usage:**
```bash
cd admin-service
node test-endpoint.js
```

## Recommendations for Future

### 1. Database Connection Pool Tuning
Monitor and adjust pool settings in `admin-service/src/config/database.js`:
```javascript
pool: {
  max: 20,      // Maximum connections
  min: 5,       // Minimum connections
  acquire: 30000,  // Timeout for acquiring connection
  idle: 10000      // Idle timeout
}
```

### 2. Query Optimization
- Add database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Consider caching for frequently accessed results
- Monitor slow queries

### 3. Monitoring & Alerting
- Set up alerts for high error rates on this endpoint
- Monitor database connection pool usage
- Track response times

### 4. Load Testing
Perform load testing to identify breaking points:
```bash
# Example with Apache Bench
ab -n 1000 -c 100 https://api.futureguide.id/api/admin/jobs/6756f626-c6bc-454d-948a-f408903e813a/results
```

## Files Modified

1. **admin-service/src/services/jobService.js**
   - Enhanced `getJobResults()` with retry logic
   - Added detailed logging
   - Explicit attribute selection

2. **admin-service/src/controllers/jobController.js**
   - Improved logging with timestamps and duration
   - Better error context

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix is working:

1. **Check logs for retry attempts:**
   ```bash
   tail -f admin-service/logs/combined.log | grep "Job results"
   ```

2. **Monitor database connection pool:**
   ```bash
   # Check health endpoint
   curl https://api.futureguide.id/admin/health
   ```

3. **Test with the problematic job ID:**
   ```bash
   curl https://api.futureguide.id/api/admin/jobs/6756f626-c6bc-454d-948a-f408903e813a/results
   ```

## Conclusion

The endpoint is now more robust with:
- ✅ Automatic retry logic for transient failures
- ✅ Better error messages and logging
- ✅ Optimized database queries
- ✅ Improved observability for debugging

The "Job not found" error should no longer occur for valid jobs that exist in the database.
